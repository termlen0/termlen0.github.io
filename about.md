  Hey there! I'm Ajay Chenampara and I am a Senior Network Automation
  Engineer at Network to Code. 
</p>

I have been doing network
administration/engineering/design/architecture for a few years now
(started right after college in 2000). For the last few years, I have
been focused on trying to "smarten" how we do networks. 

Fortunately at my job, I am able to purse network automation full time
and also help spread the message and help fellow network engineers
around the world.

###Some other things about me
- Not a fan of acronym FUD induced by: "SDN", "SDWAN", "NFV", "VNF" etc (How on earth is WAN not the network!)
- I ride motorcycles, am a huge fan of science fiction and like listening to Vinyl
